set up json server
set up rtmp server
set up client side

user should be able to log in using google account
at home page, show list of all streams
user should be able to click on a stream to navigate to that stream
there should be a button for the user to create a new stream
that button should take the user to stream creation form
user should see administrative buttons on entries he created
he should see edit button that takes him to stream editing form
he should see delete button that enables him to delete that stream

user logging in
  make a component to be responsible for logging in of the user
  the component should be responsible for showing a button for the user for logging in or logging out
  the component should be connected to redux
  redux state should contain auth object holding 2 properties:
    1- isSignedIn boolean property
    2- userId that holds the user id google account
      this is used to add authorization to the application
  we should pass thunk to redux in order to make async requests in actions 

the App component is responsible for loading and initializing google auth
it does so using the action creator googleAuthInit
that action creator is responsible for loading the auth2 library, initializing the auth2 object
it does so after waiting for 1 second for the google api to load
it dispatches an action containing the login state of the user and the userId (of kind GOOGLE_AUTH_INIT)
the authReducer receives that action and updates the store state
it sets up a listener to the login state which has callback:
  the callback receives a boolean value representing the login state of the user
  if the user is logged in, we dispatch an action of type SIGN_IN with suitable payload
  if the user is logged out, we dispatch an action of type SIGN_OUT with suitable payload

signIn action creator
uses gapi to sign in the user
waits till the sign in process is finish
dispatches an action of type SIGN_IN and payload containing isSignedIn & userId
signOut action creator same as signIn

show a button component that controls sign in state of the user when clicked on
it can sign the user in or out using signIn & signOut action creators

json server:
make json server
add some entries to it

axios custom client:
make apis folder and make streams.js file inside it
export a client whose base url is "localhost:3001"

StreamList component:
make streams folder inside components folder
make StreamList component which shows a list of streams
it uses fetchStreams action creator to get the streams into redux store

fetchStreams action creator:
it makes a request to json server to receive all the streams
it dispatches an action of type "FETCH_STREAMS" and of payload containing the array of streams

streamsReducer:
controls the state property "streams"
receives FETCH_STREAMS action and turns the payload from an array to an object and updates the state
